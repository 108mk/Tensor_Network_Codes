# Tensor_Network_Codes
$\blacksquare$ Employed Tensor network framework for design and analysis of Stabilizer Quantum error correcting codes

$\blacksquare$ Constructed 11-Qubit stabilizer code via tensor contraction of the three 5-Qubit stabilizer codes

$\blacksquare$ Evaluated code distance and maximum likelihood decoding for the 11-Qubit code via the tensor technique

$\blacksquare$ Examined the impact on successful error correction capability of a tensor network if doped suitably

<!---
As a part of the Quantum error correction review project, we explored tensor network codes (TNC). TNC has diverse and promising use in quantum error correcting codes. It is a useful tool for designing larger stabilizer codes, estimating code distance and maximum likelihood decoding. We demonstrated our review to the class and submitted an extensive report.
