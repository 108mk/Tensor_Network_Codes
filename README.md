# Tensor_Network_Codes
 As a part of Quantum error correction review project, we explored tensor network codes (TNC). TNC has diverse nad promising use in quantum error correcting codes. It is powerful tools to design larger stabilizer codes, estimating code distance and maximum likelihood decoding. We demonstrated our review to the class and submitted the extensive report.
