# Tensor_Network_Codes
 As a part of the Quantum error correction review project, we explored tensor network codes (TNC). TNC has diverse and promising use in quantum error correcting codes. It is a useful tool for designing larger stabilizer codes, estimating code distance and maximum likelihood decoding. We demonstrated our review to the class and submitted an extensive report.

## We used the codes below Module to generate stabilizer codes:
